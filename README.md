# Promote the development of education with blockchain

## I. Introduction
The development of education is of great significance to society. Openness is the basic concept of education development, and the public nature of knowledge determines the openness of education. Openness means the diversification of educational service subjects, breaking through barriers between various educational institutions and traditional professional restrictions and the limit of learning time, and building a cross-school and inter-regional credit banking system. Therefore, a credit record system that integrates security, distribution, and transparency is needed.
Today, we need an information technology approach to support distributed learning record storage and to certify learners' diverse learning achievements from different sources. Moreover, this system must have excellent security, and at the same time be open to the entire network to ensure its transparency, and the newly emerging blockchain has such capabilities. The application of blockchain can be used to solve the problem of mutual recognition difficulties in online learning, improve the credibility of online learning certificates, and ensure that the openness of education is not destroyed. Because of the potential of this technology, I will introduce the principles and current status of blockchain, and discuss possible impact of this technology on education, and use some cases that have been going on now to describe the key business model.

## II. The innovative application of blockchain in industries
### (1) The innovative application of blockchain in real industries
The success of blockchain in the financial field has aroused widespread concern, and it has begun to use this technology to construct various decentralized systems or to improve the original business model. 
Blockchain is used in the voting system to enhance the security of voting data and to prevent tampering and deletion of votes. 
Based on smart contract system, the contract function can be automatically implemented without manual intervention. 
In the IoT space, blockchain enables devices to communicate autonomously and help them manage energy and correct errors. The blockchain can effectively improve the existing IoT structure in terms of information transparency, big data management and security. Its decentralized features enable devices connected to the Internet of Things to be operated without the intervention of a central management system to achieve independent communication. For example, the Brooklyn Microgrid in New York City uses a blockchain network to connect local green energy suppliers and consumers to automate intelligent transactions and power services. This enables localization of energy production and consumption, which greatly reduces the cost of living.
Some people also use the blockchain in the health field. Just like storing financial data, the medical information is stored in the blockchain, for which the user can grasp the accessibility. 
It has also been proposed to use the blockchain to establish an intellectual property registration system to record and broadcast intellectual property records throughout the network. 
With the increasing influence of the blockchain in China, there are some innovators in the fields of insurance, social security, medical health, and law. Based on this technology, new ideas and solutions are proposed to subvert the original technical architecture and business model.

### (2) The innovative application of blockchain in education
#### (a) Overview of blockchain in education
The blockchain has been widely promoted since 2015. Recognizing the enormous innovation potential of this technology, the forerunners of the education industry have also begun to consider the application of blockchain to build educational information infrastructure, to solve educational problems and provide innovative services.
In October 2016, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued the “White Paper on Chinese Blockchain and Application Development”, pointing out that “the transparency of the blockchain system and the inability to tamper with data” are fully applicable to student credit management, career promotion, academic and qualification certificates.

At present, some educational institutions or research institutes have carried out early explorations on the educational application of blockchain. In the fall of 2015, the MIT Media Lab applied blockchain to develop a learning certificate platform and released related mobile apps, as shown in next figure. The software training facility, Holberton School, is the first school in the world to use blockchain to record academic qualifications and will share academic credentials on the blockchain starting in 2017. In the electronic badge community, the Badge Chain team is investigating how to use the blockchain to issue digital badges. In addition, educational institutions have developed a game currency mechanism used in the learning system based on the original financial currency function of the blockchain to enhance learners' motivation to learn and share knowledge on the platform.

#### (b) The methods the applications of blockchain affect education 
In the field of education, the application of blockchain and business innovation are still at the forefront of exploration. For example, blockchain in education can be used for distributed storage data logging, or as an application scenario such as Intellectual Currency; and researchers foresee the use of blockchain in open source credit certification, data security, data storage, and academic publishing. Blockchain has the following possible applications in education:

![GitHub Logo](/图片3.png)

## III. the main business models and cases of the current educational blockchain application
The blockchain business that emerged first in education and is most likely to be rapidly promoted is its application in learning records and certificate certification.

### (1) Providing decentralized learning records and credit banking services
The education application system in the future is data-centric, and various application platforms provide users with specialized services and generate individualized data. These individualized data need to be shared by all applications and require a common underlying data platform to provide support. For educational institutions, the application of blockchain to record students' learning behaviors and learning outcomes greatly simplifies the recording process and improves work efficiency. For students, this application broadens their access to educational evaluations, facilitating the preservation of learning records and credit information. From a longer-term perspective, using blockchain to record information across cross-regional, inter-academic, and even multinational learners can enable learners who learn in different environments to obtain the same effective learning record.
Similarly, credits can be certified and exchanged through this technology as a more formal learning outcome than learning records. Due to the excellent security mechanism of the blockchain, the records and inquiries of credit can be realized quickly and cost-effectively between institutions and regions. With the perfect credit recognition system, learners can easily obtain a certificate or qualification. Due to its decentralized nature, there is no need to build a central system for credit transactions when setting up a credit transfer platform, and there is no need to worry about whether there is a fairness issue. As a result, the problems of the credit bank in terms of technical means and social trust have been solved to some extent, and credit banks based on blockchain may soon appear.

**Case 1: [Sony application blockchain provides education infrastructure technology platform](https://www.sonyged.com/2016/02/22/news/working-on-the-blockchain/)**

![GitHub Logo](/图片4.png)

Sony Global Education is a Sony subsidiary established in the field of education in 2015. In February 2016, the company announced the application of blockchain in education to develop learning data sharing technologies for open and secure sharing of academic level and academic progress records. Starting with educational content, Sony has built a technology-based service platform for third-party companies, which will create a new field of education services. In this project, Sony teamed up with Holberton School and Bitproof to implement innovative applications that share academic data through blockchain. The former is an software engineering school; the latter is a blockchain notary that awards diplomas to graduates based on blockchain. They are building a blockchain application, with which students or parents who participate in the assessment will pass the test scores to third parties and after receiving the academic scores, the third parties applies the blockchain to record the academic performance, evaluates and analyzes the learning results, and then provides the learners with the learning content that best suits their interests.
With the development of the educational paradigm and technological advancement, it is expected to achieve diversified testing services and individualized evaluation methods for individuals in the future. Different evaluation providers may come up with different individual test results because of differences in evaluation methods, but each evaluation method is tailored to its own. For example, applying blockchains to the distribution of digital badges makes it easier for learning management systems to create, award, and publish digital learning records, including learning details, completions, and practices. The blockchain platform developed by Sony Global Education can track the performance of learners in traditional schools, online learning and other learning styles, and the individualized learning information of learners will become more detailed and precise.

### (2) Establish a convenient and credible certificate certification system
There are some educational institutions that have tried to record learning certificates on the blockchain to provide convenient and credible digital certificates. Using a software similar to Bitcoin Wallet, learners can store and share their own learning credentials. Based on the mobile client app, you can take it with you and show it at any time, reiterating the learner’s ownership of achievements. Although the learner cannot change the content of the learning certificate, he can decide which certificate to present to which visitor. Distributing the secret key of the digital certificate to the relevant demand side such as the employer or the student will ensure that the certificate will not be maliciously queried.
The learning information platform based on blockchain has very high security and credibility. We can create a digital file containing the basic information about the student, signing the contents of the certificate with the private key of the student, and then making digital signature. 

**Case 2: MIT's Digital Certificates** 

In June 2016, the MIT Media Lab released a report titled  [“What We Learned from Designing an Academic Certificates System on the Blockchain”](https://medium.com/mit-media-lab/what-we-learned-from-designing-an-academic-certificates-system-on-the-blockchain-34ba5874f196) which propose the use of blockchain to publish digital learning certificates and introduces the results of the research team's use of the Bitcoin blockchain and the Mozilla public badge to build  digital certificates over the past year. Since the beginning of 2016, MIT Media Lab has released digital certificates based on blockchain to the public, as shown in next figure.

![GitHub Logo](/图片5.png)

Figure Digital certificate system based on blockchain
 
The blockchain-based certificate system consists of three parts: Cert-schema, Cert-issuer and Cert-viewer. These three parts work together to broadcast the data of the learning certificate to the blockchain. The main steps for issuing a certificate are as follows: First, create a digital file containing basic information such as the name of the certificate winner, the content of the certificate, the name of the issuer (eg, MIT Media Lab), the date of issue, and so on. The certificate content is then signed and encapsulated into a certificate using a private key that only the publisher can access. A hash is generated as a watermark for later verification of whether someone has tampered with the contents of the certificate. Finally, the issuer's private key is used again to create a record on the Bitcoin blockchain, indicating that the publisher issued a certificate for someone on a certain date.
The technology used in the MIT Media Lab is not complicated and can be done in one click. The applications they developed use encrypted public and private keys to identify digital certificate issuers and winners. The app also has the ability to "delete" a certificate. In view of the fact that the blockchain itself cannot be deleted, this function does not actually delete the block, but marks the data block that is no longer used. In terms of administrative rights, the certificate owner can choose which certificates to disclose and decide on the scope of each certificate disclosure. Of course, the current certificate system is far from perfect, and the media lab also said that it will continue to develop the software to optimize the privacy issues caused by the transparency of the blockchain and the lack of infrastructure in the application. Currently, this software has released open source code on [GitHub](http://certificates.media.mit.edu/) for everyone to learn and reference. 

### (3) Reducing the cost of studying, job hunting and employment
This application is extended from the first two basic functions. At present, there are many chaos in the talent market, such as academic fraud and distortion of resume information. HireRight, a famous American background research company, found in a survey that about 86% of companies have job seekers who have obtained an interview opportunity or even been hired through academic fraud. [The link.]( http://hosteddocs.ittoolbox.com/2015-employment-screening-benchmark-report_final.pdf) In order to verify the qualifications and experience of job seekers, the human resources department needs to invest a lot of energy and has to hire specialized institutions to complete these tasks, greatly increasing the cost of recruitment.
 
![GitHub Logo](/图片6.png)

Figure Screenshot of the survey

The application of blockchain in degree certificates can completely change the verification and sharing mechanism of experience information. If training institutions can provide blockchain-based digital certificates, learners no longer have to worry about the loss of certificates, and employers and schools can verify their qualifications more easily and at lower cost. Learners no longer have to pay high fees to certify their grades and prepare their own study certificate documents. If all educational institutions use blockchain to encrypt their academic credentials, employers can use the blockchain verification tool to verify the authenticity of the job seeker's qualifications and obtain detailed information. The Holberton School mentioned in the previous section has begun to share information on academic credentials on the blockchain. A potential employer, Merkle, spent only a few seconds through the blockchain browser when doing background checks on the students.  Due to the intangible nature of the blockchain, employers no longer have to worry about the authenticity of the academic credentials.

**Case 3: “Campus Blockchain Project” of Central University of Finance and Economics**

The Central University of Finance and Economics launched a “Campus Blockchain Project”, jointly developed by Century Internet and Microsoft. It aims to use blockchain to help students record relevant documents and form a long-term effective, not tampering, non-falsifying, decentralized credit chain. They record all the academic achievements of the students during their school years, which is convenient for the recruiting unit to obtain and verify.
The project is built on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, which provides blockchain services by basic blockchain protocol of Century Internet. Azure cloud platform has diversified storage capabilities, flexible network deployment capabilities, secure data management capabilities, easy-to-expand platform architecture capabilities, and intelligent big data management capabilities for the development and deployment of campus blockchain protocols.

Figure photo from the project
 
Based on the campus blockchain, students can access individual learning achievement records through relevant services and present them to relevant agencies as needed. After receiving the resume of the student, the company can also use the system to query the student's academic credentials and awards. The use of this system simplifies the process of certifying and verifying this information for schools, individuals and organizations. The campus blockchain is a new attempt in the field of education in the blockchain, which will greatly facilitate college graduates, job seekers and employers, reducing the cost of recruiting and recruiting. In the longer run, the construction of the campus blockchain will accelerate the process of educational informatization and accelerate the integration of online space and real space.

## IV. Advantages, problems
From the characteristics of the technology itself, the blockchain has three major advantages: first is to define a data structure that can express the order; second is to build a peer-to-peer network using a cryptographic-based distributed protocol; third is to use a consensus mechanism to ensure the operation of decentralized network. 

![GitHub Logo](/图片8.png)

However, as an emerging technology, it is also, like other new things, questioned at the same time. The application of this technology to education may have privacy issues, immature technology and lack of flexibility. Although these problems may not be the problem of the blockchain itself, but of the whole business system and management methods.

![GitHub Logo](/图片9.png)

### (1)	There are few practical experiences in the field of education. Promotion and operation have some resistance
At present, there is no universal standard in the application of blockchain at home and abroad, and most of the research focuses on the financial field. Its promotion and operation in the education field will face the challenges of lack of policy protection and practical experience. First of all, due to the lack of policy protection and guidance, decentralization attributes will have a strong impact on traditional education management institutions, causing major losses to traditional education platforms in the distribution of benefits, leading that relevant institutions and departments are cautious about the application of blockchain in the field of education, which is not conducive to the large-scale promotion and application of blockchain. Secondly, due to the few application cases of blockchain in the field of education, experts and scholars have more wait-and-see attitudes towards the promotion and application of education in the field of education, and lack the motivation to promote its further application.
In order to solve the problem of the promotion and operation of the blockchain in the education field, we can start from the following three aspects: First, we should introduce the laws and regulations of the blockchain in the field of education as soon as possible, from the operational mechanism, technology application, system management, etc. The protection rules are formulated at various levels to effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of the state, institutions and individuals in the blockchain and education applications. Second, formulate a practical and profitable distribution plan, properly handle the distribution of interests between traditional education management institutions and operational platforms, and make the promotion and application of blockchains in the field of education recognized by various departments, reducing the resistance to promotion and operation. Third, relying on blockchain and application development alliances and other organizations, experts in the field of education, drawing on advanced experience from the international standardization of blockchain, and studying the hotspots and difficulties in the field of education in the field of blockchain development. The application of standards and rules for blockchain in the field of education. Therefore, educators should actively cooperate with blockchain experts to formulate application standards for blockchains in the field of education as soon as possible, open up application channels and enhance application effects. 

### (2) Blockchain data storage virtualization, disputes in educational data property rights
The decentralization of the blockchain dilutes the responsibilities of the education management organization, and the work of student data management is relatively not important. Due to the decentralized nature, the data on the blockchain is distributed and recorded, resulting in a blurred ownership of student data. The current data management in education is generally the responsibility of the school's academic affairs office, and the application of blockchain dilutes the responsibilities of the physical management department, so that the data is stored in the virtual blockchain. So who owns these virtual data? Who has the right to use? Who owns the results based on data analysis? This series of data property rights issues will become an urgent problem to be solved in the process of further promoting the application of blockchain in the field of education.

Based on the property rights of the blockchain to store data, the relevant education departments need to develop a detailed data attribution standard system and benefit value distribution plan. First, the education data stored in the blockchain should belong to the data producers, i.e. teachers, students and education management departments, rather than third-party platforms, which is the basic principle of blockchain data storage. Second, the use of any data requires the written authorization of the data producer to authorize the company to develop greater business value, but to ensure the individual interests and privacy of the data producer is the premise of data use. Finally, in the process of school-school cooperation or school-enterprise cooperation, the commercial value generated by the education data needs to formulate a clear benefit distribution plan. In addition to the agreed benefits involved in the written authorization, it can also refer to the model of copyright royalty, which is fixed by the platform. The proportion assigns benefits to data producers, data providers, and data value developers, or can obtain free authorization from users to fully attribute the benefits to data value developers. Only by formulating clear data ownership and usage norms can teachers and students' concerns about data ownership caused by education and teaching activities be dispelled, so as to better promote the application of blockchain in education.

### (3) The system network capacity is comparatively small, and the data storage space encounters a bottleneck
Blockchain is an innovation of technology, but many technical characteristics, especially network capacity, are still in the initial stage of development. The blockchain database records all data information from the beginning to the end of each transaction. Anyone who wants to store data needs to download and store a Creation Block that carries all resource information. With the application of big data technology in education, the amount of data generated by teachers, students, and education management departments will grow spurt, resulting in more and more data information carried by blocks in the blockchain. The storage space of the chain database puts forward higher requirements. The increasing amount of various types of data leads to limited data storage space, affecting the uploading and updating of data information by teachers, students, and management departments. On the other hand, it will reduce the efficiency of data dissemination and affect the real-time access of teachers and students.

Complementing the advantages of other storage technologies to form a synergistic effect is an effective way to solve the limited data storage space of blockchain. We can combine blockchain with cloud storage technology, use blockchain to build a decentralized cloud system, process the data generated by teachers, students, and management organizations, and encrypt each piece of data through tiered storage. The way is stored in the hard disk space contributed by other schools or education departments on the Internet, thus solving the problem of data storage space. At the same time, in order to ensure the unchangeable modification of the data information, a data structure of the Merkle tree can be used to determine whether the data is modified by comparing the hash value of the root node. Therefore, applying cloud storage technology to educational data storage can not only solve the problem of data storage space, but also ensure the unchangeable modification of data. In addition, McConaghy proposed the concept of Bigchain-DB, which is a decentralized database, from which data information can be written in millions of times per second, and data storage is calculated in PB. Its characteristics are mainly reflected in: decentralized control, immune attack; the number of nodes can be linearly expanded; the capacity can be expanded, and any legally binding contract and certificate can be safely stored in the blockchain database. Therefore, all kinds of educational data storage based on blockchain can adopt the core concept of Bigchain-DB, which can not only be protected from attacks, but also ensure the safety and reliability of the data of teachers and students, and expand the data storage space to realize teachers, students and education. 

### (4) Anonymous technology is not yet mature, and teacher and student privacy protection is risky
Blockchain achieves anonymity by blocking the association between the transaction address and the address holder's true identity, preventing user privacy disclosure due to the transparency of transaction information, but such protection can still be observed and tracked by block information and user ID to track down the user's personal information. Therefore, the application of blockchain in the field of education faces the risk of leakage of teachers and students' privacy, mainly from the following two aspects: First, all transaction information is open and transparent, and any information can be tracked and inquired, and some conclusions can be inferred. Or predicting the status and behavior of teachers and students, which is not conducive to the protection of teachers and students' personal privacy. Second, the security of the blockchain is guaranteed by algorithms. In theory, only 51% of node users are hacked and the data information will be leaked or tampered with, but with the development of mathematics, cryptography and computing technology, it is difficult to guarante that the algorithm will not be cracked in the future, resulting in the leakage of information from teachers and students.
The security problems inherent in the blockchain have caused widespread concern and discussion in various fields. Combined with the security challenges faced by the blockchain in the education field, the following strategies are proposed: 
First, the rights management of data generated by teachers, students, and education management departments is performed. The asymmetric encryption algorithm is used to encrypt various types of data. Only users with corresponding private keys can access the user's data information to ensure the teachers and students. Personal information is not leaked. 
Second, the combination of algorithm technology and realistic constraints, while improving the level of system algorithms, through joint legal control, departmental supervision or credit mortgage, to prevent hacking incidents.
Third, the use of big data technology to deal with advanced sustainable attacks, through the analysis of hacker attack patterns, time, space and other characteristics, build a defense system against hacker attacks, and form a synergy with the blockchain's own security system, a comprehensive upgrade privacy protection system.

It is a long process for blockchain merging into education to be recognized and credible by society. Due to the decentralized nature of blockchain, the lack of an authoritative central organization, while reducing waste of resources, has also caused the problem of declining social acceptance, which is the future blockchain in the field of education has to face. These problems cannot be solved by relying on the education department's own efforts, so we need to seek cooperation with blockchain service companies or other research institutions to improve and accelerate the application of blockchain to the field of education evaluation.


## V. Summary
Blockchain has been rapidly rising in recent years, and its application fields far exceed financial and digital currencies, and are expanding to various industries. Blockchain offers the potential to change existing business models, which helps create a decentralized education system. This article has only made some preliminary explorations and case studies, because the blockchain itself is still changing and developing. Various innovations around blockchain are constantly being tried, and new business models are constantly being invented.  Many investment institutions recognize that the development possibilities of blockchain in many industries in the future are still highly uncertain.  Most of the capital has a wait-and-see attitude and hopes to wait for the situation to be clear. There are many shortcomings in this report, such as lack of in-depth exploration and summary in practice.
